# SmartAca

SmartAca is a technology-based application aimed at digitizing the agricultural sector in Indonesia. This application leverages Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance the efficiency and yield of agriculture.

## Main Features

1. **Automatic NPK Fertilizer Application**:
   - Uses an IoT-based system to provide the right composition of NPK fertilizer according to the plant's phase.
   
2. **Climate Customization**:
   - Adjusts the greenhouse climate according to the plant's needs to optimize growth.
   
3. **AI Analysis**:
   - Uses AI to analyze plant issues through visual documentation.
   
4. **Drone Monitoring**:
   - Monitors plant conditions using drone cameras for pest and disease detection.

## Goals and Benefits

- **Increase Agricultural Efficiency**: 
  - Reduces labor costs by up to 70% using drones for efficient fertilizer and pesticide spraying.
  
- **Reduce Harvest Losses**:
  - Decreases harvest losses by up to 50% with AI-based plant health analysis.

- **Attract Younger Generations**:
  - Makes the agricultural sector more appealing to the younger generation by utilizing advanced technology.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: A framework for building responsive and attractive user interfaces (UI).
- **Firebase**: Backend for user authentication, data storage, and real-time notifications.
- **IoT**: Sensors for monitoring plant conditions and climate control.
- **AI**: Artificial intelligence technology for visual analysis of plant conditions.
